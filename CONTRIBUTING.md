# Collaborating

For collaborating with us, you don't need to be in a team with us or something like that, everyone can collaborate on the bot if they want to. But, you need to follow a few rules to ensure code quality and avoid errors.

# Rules for collaborating

- Review your code, always test your code to see if it works properly.
- Ensure code quality and convention, follow the rules stablished by the Linter in the project and the naming convention.
- PR creation, always watch for any conflict that could be in the code, we are not responsible if your PR doesn't get approved by this.
- Avoid major changes, please, avoid doing a lot of changes at once or changes that could break the code/bot.
- Follow the branch convention, follow the branch convention described in this wiki.
- Don't be a YOLO, The PR can't be directly on the main branch, they need to be in a separate branch and be made on the develop branch.

**Follow all this rules and your PR would be approved when review by our team.**
